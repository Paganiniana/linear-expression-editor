# Overview

The following project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate the concept of the linear formula, using the expression *y = mx + b*. It uses an MVC approach along with reusable classes to create a generalizable experience complete with graphed expressions (including more flexibility than simple linear formulas) and a variable number of pages.

# Running

You can open ```index.html``` in your browser or, preferably, use a simple local server. For instance, running ```python3 -m http.server``` should do the trick.
